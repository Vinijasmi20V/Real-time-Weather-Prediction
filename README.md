# Real-time-Weather-Prediction

This project predicts weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and rain for a given city using historical weather data and machine learning models. It uses data from the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather details and historical data from a CSV file to build prediction models.

Features
Fetches current weather data for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Predicts future weather conditions (temperature and humidity) using regression models.
Predicts whether it will rain tomorrow using a classification model.
Outputs predictions for multiple future time points (hourly predictions for the next 5 hours).
